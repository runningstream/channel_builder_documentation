Some useful features already exist in the Running Stream channels you build, and others are planned.

## Media Autoplay

If you'd like to automatically play video or audio content when the channel starts, instead of displaying a list of content, create a channel that only has that one file in it.  Do not have any other sublists or media.  The file will automatically play at channel startup.

You will probably want to combine this with the looping media feature.

## Looping Media

Most files will play once, then return you to the selection list.  If you want the media to loop forever, select the "Loop Media" checkbox for the media file you're interested in.  You can always press a "back" button to stop the looping.

## Image Slideshow

This feature is planned - you'll be able to add images to a sublist, and they'll be displayed as a slideshow.

## Screensaver Mode

This feature is also planned - a screensaver that runs automatically from your channel.

## Custom Channel Store Channel

You can use the Running Stream channel on any number of devices you want.  You are permitted to share credentials with anyone else you wish, as long as by sharing media you are not violating any laws in your area.  However, what if you'd like your own channel in the channel store?  Something with your name, logo, and branding on it?

This feature is planned.  It will almost certainly be a paid feature due to resource limitations for creating a channel.  The free channel features will always exist though.
